# Empirica__v2
This is an adaptation of an existing [experiment](https://github.com/amaatouq/room-assignment-csop) to version 2. To do this, I took a default V2 application and am currently modifying it file by file.The files below are the Jsx and Js files from the original study. The checkmarks indicate if I have worked on it and if it functions correctly. I will go back through it again once we have a functioning game to improve aesthetics,
